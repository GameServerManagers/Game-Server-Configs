// HttpApi configuration //
///////////////////////////

// This provides http-based API and basic web-based controls using a built-in http server.
// HttpApi is disabled by default, and if you enable it with everything else left to default it will listen only locally on 127.0.0.1:9000

// Master enable/disable toggle.
enableHttpApi : false

// Similar to logLevel above but used only for libwebsockets output.
// Note that all logging still goes through the main filter, so you won't be able to use more verbose logging here than the main level.
httpApiLogLevel : "warning"

// Interface name or IP where to bind the local http server providing the API and web-based controls.
// This is the textual name of the interface as assigned by your OS, or IP address of the interface.
// The default value is "127.0.0.1", change it to an empty string to bind the listen socket to all available interfaces.
httpApiInterface : "127.0.0.1"

// Port where the local http server listens.
httpApiPort : 9000

// Map with extra HTTP headers to add to HTTP API responses.
// The keys are the conditions for adding the headers, the values are the headers to add.
// There are no conditions supported yet, so just use "*" for a generic wildard for now, that will match everything in the future too.
httpApiExtraHeaders : {
    "*" : "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *"
}

// Http API access level overrides.
// Each HTTP API endpoint defines its default access level, usually one of "public", "private" or "admin".
// This map can override these levels to anything else. The keys are wildcard endpoint paths, and the values are the
// access levels to use. The first path that matches will be used, processing them in the order as written here.
// The wildcard patterns are case-sensitive and can contain:
// - '*': matches 0 or more characters
// - '%': matches 0 or more characters except for forward slash
// - '?': matches 1 character
httpApiAccessLevels : {
    // The default is empty, using defaults as defined by the endpoints themselves.

    // But you could for example use this to change all access levels to public (not recommended!)
    // "*" : "public"

    // Or this to hide the status from public
    // "" : "private"
    // "status" : "private"

    // And similar to hide the help and lists from public
    // "api/help" : "private"
    // "api/list*" : "private"

    // As you can see from the example above, the paths should be written with no initial or trailing slashes.
}

// Filtering rules for the access levels.
// The default access levels are "public", "private" and "admin", but the httpAccessLevels above can define any additional levels.
// This map then tells the server who has access to which level. It's a map from level names to filtering rules.
//
// Filtering rules are then specified as a list of structures, processed in the order as written in the config.
// Each rule structure contains a type" and then type-specific fields. The supported types are:
// - "accept": Accept this request, no additional checks.
// - "reject": Reject this request, no additional checks.
// - "reject-password": Reject this request and let the client know that a password is required, no additional checks.
// - "ip-accept": Accept this request if it matches the "ip" mask in CIDR notation (for example, "192.168.1.0/24")
// - "ip-reject": Reject this request if it matches the "ip" mask in CIDR notation (for example, "192.168.1.0/24")
// - "user": Accept this request if it authenticates as given "user".
// - "group" : Accept this request if it authenticates as given "group".
